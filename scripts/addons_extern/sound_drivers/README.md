**Add a Speaker and Sound<a name="add_sound"></a>**

---

Speaker Objects have been used as they are a convient way to store a sound in a blend file.  To get started add a speaker to the scene, go to the Properties window data panel and select a sound.  Speaker vismode options will become available as sounds are baked.

**Bake to multiple frequencies<a name="bake"></a>**

---

Only need to select the start and end frequencies to bake across a range.  By default bakes to 16 channels from 1 to 40,000 Hz (the audible spectrum) using a log base.

---
**Normalize Actions<a name="normalize"></a>**

---

Automatically makes the range of the action [0, 1] after baking using fcurve modifiers.  Setting normalize type to `CHANNEL` will normalize each channel from its min, max to [0, 1], or whatever range you choose.  Reverse ranges will invert the fcurves

**NLA Stack<a name="nla_stack"></a>**

---

Bake or copy actions and add to the outcome using the NLA editor. Actions are automatically added to the NLA stack on baking. The action in the action slot ( assigned action to speaker) is the active action.  Other actions are saved (stacked) and actively take place in the animation. For example an action can be copied, then normalized to [radians(-180), radians(180)] to use this channel as a driver target for rotation properties.

**Make Visualisers Quickly<a name="visualize"></a>**

---

Create and drive an object or set of objects with channel 0 of a sound bake, and the automatically produce a grid of objects, each driven by the corresponding channel.

Not sure what instrument is making that sound, well with an associated midi bake we can tell.
