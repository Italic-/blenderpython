My collection of Blender Addons

[Prebuilt collection for Windows x86_64 (Blender 2.78a)]
--

Requirements
--
* For complete Feature set:
* Blender 2.78 BuildBot Build ONLY!!!! https://builder.blender.org/download/ near Christmas 2016
* blenderpython zip, unpacked.
* This repo is currently an experimental set of all addons collected, with the aim of a 2.78++ super build.
* My current Config folder. plays a huge role in this, Please use the Config folder & follow instructions.
* If you want to deactivate an addon by default, restart Blender after.
* Warning: 
* Many Files have neem modified & the repo somewhat relies upon the Config folder to make more sense.

Intallation
--
* Using Blnder 2.78a Zip Version! https://www.blender.org/download/
* Unpack to a location of your choice!
* Browse the folder structure to \blender-2.78a-windows64\2.78
* Copy/paste the config & scripts folder from blenderpython zip into \blender-2.78a-windows64\2.78
* This will overwrite only the files I have updated!
* Alternativly you can download the repo & pick what you need, but some addons,  especially properties shelf addons rely upon:
* https://github.com/meta-androcto/blenderpython/tree/master/scripts/addons_extern/AF_view3d_mod
* https://github.com/meta-androcto/blenderpython/tree/master/scripts/addons_extern/AF_view3d_mod
* Some blender modules files have been changed, that said I have the toolshelf tabs & properties shelf tabs written as addons.
* Many addons have been modified to fit into the new Tabs order I constructed.
* Addons are kept reasonably up-to-date. Check the author's source for the most recent updates.
* If using my Custom Tabs addons  & config you might need to change panel locations when updating some addons so they fit in.
* This is done for the active config addons.

Note:
--
* Use at your own risk!
* Some addons are hard coded to addons_extern folder. Open the \__init__.py file for the addon & shortly below the addon information there will be text with path & addons in it.
* Be careful using addons_extern! Some addons work on high volumes of data, resulting in slow calculations and higher potential to crash.
* Addons are enabled by default using the config
* Save Often. I'm not responsible for any lost effort or broken addons.
